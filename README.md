Todo list management application
================================

Todo list allows to maintain flat list of tasks that have priorities and text description.

A user can:
- register and log in
- see todo list displayed
- manipulate list (add/remove/modify entries)
- assign priorities to the entries.
- could do the same using a very simple REST api.

The front-end is using Ajax exclusively. No page reload.
