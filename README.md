Todo list management application
================================

Todo list allows to maintain flat list of tasks that have priorities and text description.

A user can:
- register and log in
- I can have my todo list displayed
- I can manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries)
- Assign priorities to the entries.
- I could do the same using a very simple REST api.
- The front-end is using Ajax exclusively.
